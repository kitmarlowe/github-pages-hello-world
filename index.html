            <h1>Hello World</h1>
            <p>My name is <strong>Chris Banker</strong> and I am currently pursuing a degree in web development at Clark
                College. My journey into web development began about a year and a half ago when I made the exciting
                decision to
                transition from my initial interest in history to the dynamic world of coding and web design.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've embarked on a comprehensive educational path, delving into various programming languages
                and web
                technologies. I started with an introduction to programming using Python, where I learned the
                fundamentals of
                logical thinking and problem-solving. From there, I expanded my skills into the realms of HTML/CSS,
                JavaScript,
                and WordPress, honing my abilities to create visually appealing and interactive web interfaces.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am immersed in the realm of PHP/SQL1, exploring the backend of web development and
                understanding
                how databases and server-side scripting work together to create dynamic web applications. Each course I
                undertake deepens my understanding of web development and propels me closer to my goal of becoming a
                proficient
                and innovative web developer.</p>
